## 🧠 About Me

Hi, I'm Zwe — a cybersecurity graduate with a growing passion for **penetration testing** and **vulnerability assessment**. I’ve traded in hours of gaming for the thrill of **reconnaissance, enumeration, exploitation, pivoting**, and **breaking into systems (ethically, of course!)**.  

This GitHub is my personal lab — a place where I upload my **hands-on projects**, **CTF writeups**, and tools/scripts I develop along the way.

## 🎮 Fun Fact

Lately, penetration testing has *replaced* my gaming habit — I get the same rush from **finding flaws**, **hacking into systems**, and **solving technical puzzles**, just like leveling up in a game.
